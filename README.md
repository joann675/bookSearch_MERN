# bookSearch_MERN

### Overview

BookSearch_MERN is a React-based Google Books Search app.
Users can search for books via the Google Books API. The user will have the option
to "view" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "save" a book,
saving it to a Mongo database.

The saved page renders all books that were saved to the database.
Again, the user will have an option to "view" the book or "delete" a book which
removes it from the Mongo database.

This application is deployed at https://shrouded-wildwood-69404.herokuapp.com/
